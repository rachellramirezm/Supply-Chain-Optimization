# 📦 Supply Chain Logistics Optimization
From historical logistics data to optimized network decisions

## 👋 What is this project?

This project analyzes a real-world supply chain logistics network to understand how orders were historically routed and how logistics decisions impact total operational cost.

The project evaluates plants, routes, carriers, and warehouse capacity usage in order to identify inefficiencies and design a lower-cost logistics strategy.

It follows a real-world Data Analyst → Data Modeling → Optimization workflow, starting from raw operational tables and progressing toward a cost-minimized logistics network.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Transform raw logistics data into structured, reliable information that can be used to evaluate network performance and design an optimized routing strategy.

The focus is not only measuring logistics performance, but improving it through data-driven optimization.

## 🧠 Key Questions Answered

### Network Evaluation

- What is the total logistics cost of the historical network?
- Which plants, routes, and carriers are used most frequently?
- What is the average transportation time across routes?
- How efficiently is warehouse capacity utilized?

### Inefficiency Detection

- Which routes generate the highest logistics costs?
- Which carriers are the most expensive for similar routes?
- Which plants are operating near or at capacity limits?
- Are there lower-cost routing alternatives that were not used historically?

### Network Optimization

- What is the optimal assignment of orders that minimizes total logistics cost?
- How much cost reduction can be achieved through optimization?
- How does warehouse utilization change after optimization?
